# Architecture

## System boundary

Remote Pointer has three deployable or reusable components:

| Component | Responsibility | Must not do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RemotePointer.Client` | Presenter calibration/capture and receiver marker overlays | Capture screens or inject remote input |
| `RemotePointer.Server` | Validate, authorize, rate-limit, and relay transient pointer events | Access either user's desktop |
| `RemotePointer.Contracts` | Transport-neutral messages, coordinate math, JSON policy, and structural validation | Depend on WPF, SignalR, or ASP.NET Core |

Both clients will establish outbound HTTPS/WSS connections to the server. The server will place the approved presenter and receiver in a session-specific SignalR group. Peer-to-peer connectivity is deliberately excluded.

## Phase 1 design

The contracts assembly targets `net10.0` and contains no desktop or web framework references. Coordinates use small immutable value types based on `double`, allowing later callers to keep WPF-DIP and physical-pixel conversion at the platform boundary.

`CoordinateMapper.Normalize` uses a calibrated rectangle that can have a negative origin. It clamps its result to the inclusive normalized range. `CoordinateMapper.Denormalize` requires an already valid normalized coordinate; malformed network input must be rejected rather than silently corrected.

Structural contract validation returns stable error codes and does not throw for untrusted messages. Session membership, role authorization, expiry, and rate limits require server state and remain server responsibilities for Phase 4. `SequenceNumberTracker` provides a bounded replay/reordering window that the server can maintain per approved presenter session.

## Dependency direction

```text
RemotePointer.Client ----+
                         +--> RemotePointer.Contracts
RemotePointer.Server ----+
```

No reference is permitted from contracts back to either host. Client and server tests reference only the corresponding production project and contracts as needed.

## Phase status

- Phase 1: implemented.
- Phases 2–7: not yet implemented.
